- **Directory**: `kimi/examples/plan_with_todo/docs/2025_11_14/`
- **Purpose**: Store Tier 3 operational documentation
- **Time**: <0.01h ✨ Immediate completion

### UPDATE: SetTodoList with initial progress ✅
- **Action**: Updated todo list to reflect first 3 completed tasks
- **Status**: Used `SetTodoList` tool to update task states
- **Progress**: 3/29 tasks now marked as "Done"
- **Time**: 0.02h ✨ Fast status update

## 📝 Key Decisions & Learnings

### Decision 1: Documentation Granularity
**Decision**: Create more detailed Tier 2 documents than minimal requirements
**Rationale**: Better example for users learning the system
**Impact**: Slightly higher time investment (0.85h vs 0.5h estimated) but much better reference material

### Decision 2: SetTodoList Integration Depth
**Decision**: Document comprehensive usage patterns and git integration
**Rationale**: Makes the example self-documenting and educational
**Impact**: FEATURE_TODO.md is larger (420+ lines) but more valuable as a reference

### Decision 3: Tier 3 File Structure
**Decision**: Create 4 sequential files for Tier 3 instead of minimal approach
**Rationale**: Better demonstrates daily execution pattern
**Impact**: More realistic example, clearer progression

## ⏭️ Next Steps

### Immediate (this session):
- [ ] TASK-1.5: Create 4 Tier 3 log files (sequential: 0001 through 0004)
  - 20251114_0001_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md (THIS FILE - 18:45)
  - 20251114_0002_INITIAL_SETUP.md (next: 18:50)
  - 20251114_0003_IMPLEMENTATION.md (18:55)
  - 20251114_0004_FINAL_TESTING.md (19:00)
- [ ] TASK-1.6: Verify cross-references
- [ ] TASK-1.7: Final verification of Tier 2 → Tier 3 links

### This Session Goals:
- [ ] Complete Feature 1 (7/7 tasks = 100%)
- [ ] Update SetTodoList to reflect completion
- [ ] Create first git checkpoint for Feature 1

## ⏱️ Time Tracking

| Task | Estimated | Actual | Variance |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| TASK-1.1 | 0.25h | 0.25h | ✨ Perfect! |
| TASK-1.2 | 0.25h | 0.3h | +0.05h (more detail) |
| TASK-1.3 | 0.2h | 0.35h | +0.15h (comprehensive notes) |
| TASK-1.4 | <0.1h | <0.01h | ✨ Fast! |
| SetTodoList update | 0.05h | 0.02h | ✨ 60% under! |
| **Session Total** | **0.85h** | **0.93h** | **+0.08h (+9%)** |

**Notes**: Slightly over due to additional documentation detail at Tier 2, but this creates a better learning example. Overall efficiency remains excellent.

## 🔗 Cross-References

**Tier 1:**
- [ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md](../../ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md) - Strategic overview

**Tier 2:**
- [FEATURE_PLAN.md](../FEATURE_PLAN.md) - Feature specifications
- [FEATURE_TODO.md](../FEATURE_TODO.md) - Task tracking (updated 18:45)

**Documentation References:**
- [kimi/KIMI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md](../../../../KIMI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) - Workflow patterns used

---

## 🚧 Blockers & Issues

**None** - Smooth execution so far!

**Potential Concerns:**
- Time tracking shows slight overrun trend (+9%)
- Need to watch scope creep in remaining tasks
- Feature 3 (parallel patterns) may need more time than estimated

**Mitigation:**
- Stay focused on core example requirements
- Skip some optional "bonus" features if needed
- Keep Feature 3 demonstrations simple and focused

---

## 💡 Insights for Template Users

### What Worked Well:
1. **Parallel Planning**: Thinking through all tiers before implementation reduced rework
2. **Comprehensive Tier 2**: Detailed feature specs made task breakdown straightforward
3. **SetTodoList First**: Creating the full todo list early provides clear roadmap
4. **Time Tracking**: Real-time tracking helped identify scope creep early

### Recommendations:
1. **Spend time on Tier 1**: Clear architecture makes everything else easier
2. **Be realistic with estimates**: Better to under-promise and over-deliver
3. **Document decisions**: Future you will thank present you for detailed logs
4. **Update SetTodoList frequently**: Keeps momentum and shows progress
