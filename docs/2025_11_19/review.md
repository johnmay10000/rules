# Repository Review: Rules & Agents

**Date**: 2025-11-19

## 1. Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive, "pure documentation" rule set for AI coding assistants (Cursor, Gemini, Kimi). It does not contain runtime code but instead provides strict guidelines, functional programming (FP) patterns, and workflow rules to ensure high-quality, consistent code generation across multiple languages.

The core documentation for agents has been effectively split from a single `AGENTS.md` into three modular files to comply with strict file size limits:
1.  **`AGENTS_OVERVIEW.md`**: Project structure and mandatory conventions.
2.  **`AGENTS_WORKFLOWS.md`**: How-to guides and content creation workflows.
3.  **`AGENTS_REFERENCE.md`**: Tools, warnings, and statistics.

## 2. Key Findings

### 2.1. Strict Compliance & Governance
The repository enforces a rigorous set of rules that are explicitly designed for AI agents to follow:
*   **File Size Limits**: A hard limit of 350 lines per file (target 250-300) is enforced to maintain readability and manage context windows. The split of `AGENTS.md` is a direct application of this rule.
*   **Git Workflow**: A mandatory "checkpoint" strategy requires commits every 30-60 minutes with a specific, detailed message format. This is crucial for preserving context and allowing safe reverts.
*   **Documentation Hierarchy**: A strict 3-tier structure (Architecture -> Plans -> Daily Logs) ensures that all work is tracked and contextualized.

### 2.2. Multi-Agent Support
The repository is not limited to a single tool. It explicitly supports:
*   **Cursor**: The primary target, with extensive rules in `cursor/`.
*   **Kimi**: Dedicated support in `kimi/`, acknowledging its unique tool-based architecture (parallel file I/O, `SetTodoList`).
*   **Gemini**: Supported via `gemini/`, mirroring the structure of other tools.

### 2.3. Functional Programming Focus
There is a strong, unified emphasis on Functional Programming patterns across 6 languages (Python, TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin, Rust, Haskell). The "Universal Pattern" (Railway Oriented Programming) is standardized, ensuring that code generated by agents follows a consistent, robust design regardless of the language.

### 2.4. Active Planning
The `docs/plans/` directory contains numerous active implementation plans (e.g., `MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `KIMI_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`), demonstrating that this is a living, evolving project with clear strategic direction.

## 3. Analysis of `AGENTS.md` Split

The decision to split `AGENTS.md` was necessary and beneficial.
*   **Pros**:
    *   **Context Management**: Smaller files are easier for LLMs to ingest and retain in context.
    *   **Modularity**: Separation of concerns (Overview vs. Workflows vs. Reference) allows agents to load only what they need.
    *   **Compliance**: Adheres to the repo's own 350-line limit.
*   **Cons**:
    *   **Human Navigation**: Humans may find it slightly more cumbersome to jump between three files compared to one master document, but the cross-linking is well-implemented.

## 4. Recommendations

1.  **Maintain the Split**: The split structure should be the standard for all large documentation files in this repo.
2.  **Automated Validation**: Consider adding a simple script (even if just a shell script in `scripts/`) to validate file sizes and link integrity, as mentioned in `AGENTS_REFERENCE.md`.
3.  **Expand Kimi Support**: The `KIMI_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` suggests active work here; continuing to build out Kimi-specific templates that leverage its parallel capabilities is a high-value area.

## 5. Conclusion

This repository is a model for "Agent-First" documentation. It treats prompts and rules as code, applying engineering discipline (version control, modularity, linting via file size) to prompt engineering. The `AGENTS.md` split is a successful execution of these principles.
